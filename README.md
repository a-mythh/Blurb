# blurb

Welcome to blurb! This is a sleek and efficient dictionary application built using Flutter. Tired of using Google for quick word lookups and finding the interface cumbersome and distracting, I decided to create a more streamlined and elegant solution.

## Features

- **Fast and Simple UI**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Elegant Design**: Clean aesthetics and thoughtful design choices make for a visually appealing app (swipe-able flashcards for meanings).
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle animations are integrated to enhance user experience, making interactions fluid and enjoyable.
- **Comprehensive Word Lookup**: Leveraging the free dictionary API, this app provides detailed definitions, pronunciations, and example usages.
- **Local Word Storage**: Users can save words locally in a database and access them offline.
- **Autocomplete Functionality**: A simple backend built with Node.js and MongoDB provides autocomplete suggestions.
